# Workshop: Machine Learning for Beginners

This repository contains the code for the workshop "Machine Learning for
Beginners" as presented in various occasions at
[WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management](https://www.whu.edu), such as the
[Campus for Supply Chain Management](https://www.campus-for-supply-chain-management-cscm.de/),
[IdeaLab](https://www.idealab.io)'s [IdeaHack](http://www.ideahack.io), or
within many [executive education](https://ee.whu.edu/) programs.


## Prerequisites

To be suitable for *total beginners*, there are *no* prerequisites.
If you are interested to learn more after this workshop, check out the
full-semester course **[Introduction to Python & Programming](https://github.com/webartifex/intro-to-python)**.


## Installation

To follow this workshop on your own computer, a working installation of
**Python 3.6** or higher is required.

A popular and beginner friendly way is to install the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
that not only ships Python but comes pre-packaged with a lot of third-party
libraries from the so-called "scientific stack".
Just go to the [download](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
section and install the latest version (i.e., *2019-10* with Python 3.7 at the
time of this writing) for your operating system.

Then, among others, you will find an entry "Jupyter Notebook" in your start
menu.
Click on it and a new tab in your web browser will open where you can switch
between folders as you could in your computer's default file browser.

To download the course's materials as a ZIP file, click on the green "Clone or
download" button on the top right on this website.
Then, unpack the ZIP file into a folder of your choosing (ideally somewhere
within your personal user folder so that the files show up right away).
